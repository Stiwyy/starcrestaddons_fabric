## Features

 **Base64 Link Decoder**  
- Detects and decodes Base64-encoded URLs posted in chat.  
- Converts them into normal clickable links for easy access.  

**Imgur Image Viewer**  
- Opens Imgur links directly in a pop-up image viewer inside Minecraft.  
- No need to tab out of the game or copy links.  

**Client-side Only**  
- Starcrest Addons is 100% client-side. Itâ€™s safe to use on Hypixel as it doesnâ€™t send any data to the server or perform automated actions.
